        First and foremost, I AM AN ARTIST. I started my career as a graphic designer after graduating from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and moving to Arizona. For the eight years I was in Arizona I was a picture framer at Michael&#39;s, Graphic Designer at a Print Shop, Web Designer/Developer at a Software Company, Computer Lab Manager at a High School, Freelance Photographer and a Graphic Design/Photography Teacher. Whew&#8230; that&#39;s a lot in 8 years. However, I have learned so much over the years and had the opportunity to experience a lot of different industries which makes me more valuable.<br>
        I am almost done with my Masters Degree which is in Web Design and New Media. I will be presenting my final thesis after learning what I need with my second Bachelors and with the hopes that it will be approved and I will officially be graduated! <br>
            This fall I did decide to go back to school for a Bachelors of Science in Web Design and Development. To you it may not make sense, but it was the best decision I made. I learned a lot with my Masters but didn&#39;t learn everything I was looking to learn. In my few months at Full Sail University, I have found what I was desiring to learn. You don&#39;t ever stop learning! :)<br>
So that brings me to the now&#8230; I moved back to my hometown of Warren, PA with the realization that I like small towns and the big cities are good to visit but not to live. I like running into people that I know. I enjoy that people look you in the eye when walking by you and say hello and ask how you are doing. I like that rush hour consists of a few extra cars at a stop sign and the traffic lights turn to blinkers at night.<br>
I am currently freelancing with graphic/web design and photography. I am re-establishing my screen printing business that I do as a side job/ hobby. I am also spending time on my art that I have been putting off, painting and drawing mostly. And I now make my own custom frames.
